# Introduction
Hi my name is Yeongyu Kim, and I try to find good and meaningful things and do it.

I am a student interested in sports, body training, computer, math, science, etc. (Good not to restrict yourself in one area!)

I have thought of making my blog before, but now I am making one for the Open Source Course homework.

I am checking for software news frequently these days. Things are changing fast! I want to learn skills with a bright future.
