# Introduction
Hi my name is Yeongyu Kim, and I try to find good and meaningful things and do it.

I am a student interested in sports, body training, computer, math, science, etc. (Good not to restrict yourself in one area!)

I have thought of making my blog before, but now I am making one for the Open Source Course homework.

I am checking for software news frequently these days. Things are changing fast! I want to learn skills with a bright future.

# Skills
In programming, I have most experience with Python (Machine Learning, Web Crawling, ...)
## I made
* SKKU Notice Telegram Bot
* Mock university appliance site Crawler
* snake game with C
## I have tried
* Kaggle (Fasion Mnist, Spiral, Titanic)
* Big Data crawling analysis on [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/) site
